# My first solo project

# AI image caption generator

The AI Image Caption Generator is a web application that allows users to upload an image and generate a caption using AI. The application consists of a Vue 3 frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to handle AI-based caption generation.

# Tech Stack

Frontend: Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify (UI Framework), Axios (HTTP Requests)
Backend: FastAPI, Uvicorn (ASGI Server), CORS Middleware
AI Model: Hugging Face API (nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning)

# AI implementation

1️ - Computer Vision (Image Captioning)
Utilizing Hugging Face’s vit-gpt2-image-captioning model, which is a vision-language model.
This model analyzes an image and generates a text description.
It is a combination of Vision Transformer (ViT) for image processing and GPT-2 for text generation.

2️ - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The GPT-2 part of the model processes the visual features and converts them into human-readable captions.
This falls under natural language generation (NLG), which is a subfield of NLP.

3️ - AI API Integration
The FastAPI backend interacts with Hugging Face's AI models, using AI as a service.
The API request sends an image as input, and the model returns AI-generated text.

❓How AI Works in this Project❓
1️⃣ User uploads an image
2️⃣ FastAPI server sends the image to Hugging Face's AI model
3️⃣ The model extracts features from the image (Computer Vision)
4️⃣ The GPT-2 model generates a caption (NLP)
5️⃣ API returns the AI-generated text
